This repository is my personal space for documenting everything I’m learning about Web3.  
It contains:  

- Summaries and reflections from lectures

## 📂 Repository Structure  

I’m organizing my learnings **week by week** for clarity and easy tracking:  


```text 
Week-1/   → Learnings, tasks, and assignments from Week 1  
Week-2/   → Learnings, tasks, and assignments from Week 2  
Week-3/   → Learnings, tasks, and assignments from Week 3  
...

```


Each weekly folder typically includes:  

- A short summary of topics covered that week  
- Assignments, exercises, or projects done during the week  
- Key takeaways or code snippets  

This structure makes it easy to navigate and see progress over time.
