 Program Derived Address (PDA) 

A Program Derived Address (PDA) is a special type of address on the Solana blockchain that is generated by a program rather than being associated with a private key. PDAs are used to create accounts that are controlled by smart contracts (programs) rather than by individual users. This allows for more secure and flexible interactions within decentralized applications (dApps).
