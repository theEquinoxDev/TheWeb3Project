 Program Derived Address (PDA) 

A Program Derived Address (PDA) is a special type of address on the Solana blockchain that is generated by a program rather than being associated with a private key. PDAs are used to create accounts that are controlled by smart contracts (programs) rather than by individual users. This allows for more secure and flexible interactions within decentralized applications (dApps).

Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) provide developers on Solana with two main use cases:

- Deterministic Account Addresses: PDAs provide a mechanism to deterministically derive an address using a combination of optional "seeds" (predefined inputs) and a specific program ID.

Deterministic account addresses means that given the same seeds and program ID, the resulting PDA will always be the same. This allows developers to create predictable and consistent account addresses for their applications.

- Enable Program Signing: The Solana runtime enables programs to "sign" for PDAs which are derived from its program ID.

## Properties

- PDAs are addresses derived deterministically using
    - a combination of user-defined seeds
    - a bump seed
    - and a program's ID.

### Jargons

1. seeds: in simple terms, seeds are like ingredients you use to create a unique recipe. In the context of PDAs, seeds are pieces of data (like strings or numbers) that you provide to help generate a specific address. By using different combinations of seeds, you can create different PDAs.
they are a bunch of words used to derive an address. 

2. bump: a number between 1-255
3. off the curve: The PDA that we are generating doesn't have a private key. 

These are the main properties of PDAs:
- No Private Key: PDAs do not have an associated private key, making them more secure for certain applications.
- Program Control: PDAs are controlled by the program that created them, allowing for automated management of funds and data.
- Deterministic Generation: PDAs can be generated in a predictable manner using seeds and the program ID.
- Off-Curve Addresses: PDAs are designed to be "off the curve," meaning they cannot be derived from a private key, enhancing security.
