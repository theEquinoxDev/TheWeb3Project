# Dapp
A dapp is a decentralized application that runs on a blockchain network, leveraging smart contracts to facilitate trustless interactions between users. Unlike traditional applications that rely on centralized servers, dapps operate on a peer-to-peer network, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability of data.

in simple terms: A dapp is an application that is not controlled by a single entity but instead runs on a blockchain, making it more secure and transparent.

## Key Features of Dapps:
1. **Decentralization**: Dapps operate on a decentralized network, meaning no single entity has control over the application.
2. **Open Source**: The codebase of dapps is typically open source, allowing    anyone to inspect, modify, and contribute to the development of the application.    
3. **Smart Contracts**: Dapps utilize smart contracts to automate processes and enforce rules without the need for intermediaries.

## Flow of a Dapp:
1.  Users interact with the dapp through a user interface, which can be a web or mobile application.
2.  When a user performs an action (e.g., sending tokens, voting), the dapp creates a transaction that is signed with the user's private key.
3.  Dapp requests the user's wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to approve and send the transaction to the blockchain network.
4.  User approves the transaction in their wallet and sends it to the blockchain.

Any website can be called a dapp as long as it requests a transaction from the user's wallet.
